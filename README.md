# Predicting Loan Defaults with Keras

#### In this project, I use data from LendingClub to build a Keras neural network model that can predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on their customer profile. 

#### I have included the Jupyter Notebook containing my code in which I clean the dataset, perform some feature engineering, and finally build and evaluate my model. I have also included all the output from running my code so you can see the results directly in the notebook, and I have included the trained Keras model as an HDF5 file. There are two .csv files that contain the data I used for this project. These files can be found in the Data folder and must be downloaded if youâ€™re interested in recreating this project on your own machine.
